    "**Technique Used:**  \n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing using NLTK and TF-IDF (scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "1. Normalized text data by converting all text to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tokenized text into individual words using NLTK tokenization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Removed stopwords and non-alphabetic tokens to reduce noise in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reconstructed clean text after preprocessing for feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Applied TF-IDF vectorization to transform text into numerical feature representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Analyzed similarity between text samples using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights:\n",
    "- Tokenization and stopword removal significantly improved text clarity and reduced irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TF-IDF effectively captured important words and their relevance across different text samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NLP preprocessing is essential for converting raw text into a format suitable for machine-learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prepared NLP pipeline can be extended to sentiment analysis or text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Milestone:**  \n",
    "NLP preprocessing pipeline successfully completed — text data is now ready for feature extraction and modeling.\n",
    "This milestone enables future integration of text-based analysis into the overall project.\n",
